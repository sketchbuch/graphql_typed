# GraphQL Typed

**graphql_typed**

A test repo to learn about more about TypeGraphQL which I use at my current employer. Based on tutorials at: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN3n1USn4xlma1bBu3Tloe4NyYn9Ko8Gs

This is not intended to be used, it was just the result of me following along the above linked tutorial. The code is not mine, most is copy+pasted from the Ben Awad's Github Repo that accompanies the video tutorials: https://github.com/benawad/type-graphql-series
